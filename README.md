# Boids Built Using openFrameworks

Flocking behaviour modeled using location, velocity, acceleration, and perception.

Built as a code Kata with an intent to learn the [openFrameworks C++ creative coding toolkit](https://openframeworks.cc/).

## Source Code

This is a C++ program written in the `setup/update/draw` [openFrameworks style](https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/how_of_works.html).

## Movement in Nature

[Boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) exhibits flocking behaviours in groups according to the "Rules of Reynolds". 

Although [I've coded boids before](https://github.com/stungeye/Hungry-Boids-for-Shoes), this code was inspired by the [Autonomous Agents / Steering Behaviour Chapter](https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-6-autonomous-agents/) in [Daniel Shiffman's book The Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com).
